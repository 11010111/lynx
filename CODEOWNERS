# Each line represents a rule, followed by a list of members.
# These members are the default owners for all files that match the specified pattern.
# The pattern generally follows the same syntax used for .gitignore files.
# The last matching rule always wins; those that appear lower in the file take precedence over rules that appear higher up.
# Specify owners by their username, email, or role assignment in the project.
